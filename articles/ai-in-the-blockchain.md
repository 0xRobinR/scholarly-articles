### what is AI actually?

AI defines the computer capability of handling programs using human-intelligence, well, basically outperforming human.

a not so long time ago, when machines were just capable of undergoing mathematical operations with logical gates, there were some terms coined for the evolution of handling these calculations artificially.

many assumptions and works were initiated to create the "artificial brain", and with alan turing's [computing machinery and intelligence](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238?login=false) method of **imitation game**, computer scientists were able to compute the machine intelligence of a system.

these groundworks from scientists and data engineers paved the way to the dawn of the [AI era](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/history#definition). an AI, for now, is just a machine predicting the next outcome from previously fed data, the more data, the more is the accuracy of "predicting". and for data, user-centric systems focuses on utilizing user resources in their [learning](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/zoom-updates-its-policy-that-allowed-it-to-collect-user-data-and-train-ai-2418103-2023-08-08), which is probably not good way of collecting information without the end-user knowledge and no benefits to them.

AI is now seen as *minimizing complex task*, while still training from the information accessible from the trainers, a centralized entitiy.

recent growths, however, were highly recognized as an effort towards the growth of artificial intelligence, there are stil some improvements to be done.
